    <h2><em>Playing</em> with web design?</h2>
    <p>Why not?</p>
    <p>
      Sure, there's a lot to learn if you're just starting out, but it's only
      difficult if you try to learn it all at once. Web Design can be fun. It
      can be fustrating sometimes, but when you see your own work up there on
      the screen, it's worth it. Besides, as Mary Poppins once said:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      For every job that must be done, there is an element of fun. Find the fun
      and, snap, the job's a game!
    </blockquote>

    <p>So let's get started!</p>

    <p>
      If you know absolutely nothing about web design, start by reading
      "<a href="generaltutorials/getting-ready.html">Getting Ready for Web Design</a>"
      where I will help you install the applications you need to have. Then read
      "<a href="htmltutorials/first.html">Your First Web Page</a>" and we can get
      this show on the road. Once you've gotten through the basics, you can begin
      to make your websites look better by getting started with CSS.
