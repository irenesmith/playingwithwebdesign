    <h2>More HTML Tags</h2>

    <p>Now that we have created a page, let’s back up a bit and talk about some of the
    most commonly used tags. Tags define HTML elements.</p>

    <h3>Creating paragraphs</h3>

    <p>The first tag you need to know how to use is the paragraph element, defined by
    opening and closing the &lt;p&gt; tags.</p>

    <p>With the tags I have shown you so far, you could actually create a web page. It
    would be boring to look at, but it would be a page that people could read.
    Let’s add a little bit of interest. I’m going to give you a few more tags to
    play with. And that is exactly what you should do, by the way, <em>play</em>!</p>

    <h3>Headings</h3>

    <p>HTML defines headings with levels from one to six. You use the heading tags the
    same way as the paragraph tag. The heading tags look like this:</p>

    <pre>
    &lt;h1&gt;This is heading level 1&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;This is heading level 2&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;This is heading level 3&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;This is heading level 4&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;h5&gt;This is heading level 5&lt;/h5&gt;
    &lt;h6&gt;This is heading level 6&lt;/h6&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>If you were to look at that code as it is rendered in the browser, it would
    look something like this:</p>

    <p><img src="img/heading_tags.png" alt="Heading tags" /></p>

    <p>To tell the truth, I’ve seldom gone any further than heading level three, but
    all six of them are there for your use. Remember that the look of each of these
    headings can be modified through the use of CSS. What we are looking at here is
    the default formatting supplied by my browser.</p>

    <h2 id="characterformats">Character formats</h2>

    <p>Here are some tags you can use to control the look of your text. These tags are
    used on sections of text within a paragraph or other container. So far you’ve
    seen the heading tags and paragraph tags; we’ll talk about other containers
    later.</p>

    <p>Here are the text formatting tags:</p>

    <p><strong>&lt;em&gt;</strong> - The em tag defines text that should be emphasized in some way. You
    might use it to set off a technical term, for example. Most browsers will
    render text between the &lt;em> and &lt;/em&gt; tag using italics, but once we
    start working with CSS, you’ll see that you can change that to suit the content
    of the page.</p>

    <p><strong>&lt;strong&gt;</strong> - The strong tag indicates text that should stand out. In most
    cases the text marked as strong will be display in boldface type but this isn’t
    necessarily so because, as with &lt;em&gt;, you can define other formatting for
    this tag using CSS. All of the text between the opening &lt;strong&gt; and the
    closing &lt;strong&gt; will be formatted so that it stands out from the
    surrounding text.</p>

    <p><strong>&lt;small&gt;</strong> - Text formatted with the small tag is rendered in a smaller font
    than the surrounding text. It can be useful for a subtitle, or for information
    that is less important than the surrounding text.</p>

    <p><strong>&lt;cite&gt;</strong> - Used to mark the name of a work, such as a song, movie, book, or
    play. This text is usually rendered as italic.</p>

    <h3>Your second page</h3>

    <p>Let’s finish by creating a slightly more interesting web page. Let’s create a
    page about you! Once you’ve entered the following text, save it. The name
    “aboutme.html” is a good choice for this one. Don’t forget to replace my
    placeholder text with your own information! I’ve set off the text you need to
    change with { and }, the curly braces.</p>

    <pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
    &lt;html lang=”en”&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;About {Your Name}&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;All About {Your Name} &lt;small&gt;{your email}&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hi, my name is &lt;strong&gt;{Your first name}&lt;/strong&gt; and I have created
          this website to show my skills with HTML. I am a {your job title} and
          am learning HTML in order to expand my skills.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;My Family&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;{Tell us about your family here.}&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;My Job&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;{Put stuff about your job here!}&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <p>For example, take a look at a screenshot of my “About Irene” page. Notice that
    the text between &lt;small&gt; and &lt;/small&gt; is slightly smaller than the
    rest of the line. Also notice the extra space between the headings and the
    paragraphs. That can be changed. When you get to the second on CSS, I will teach
    you exactly how to do that.</p>

    <p>You’ve seen how to create a web page and how to use a handful of HTML tags. In
    coming sections, we'll expand your knowledge of tags, and show you a little bit
    about how to make your web pages more attractive.</p>

    <h3>Exercises</h3>

    <ol>
    <li>
      Create a basic web page that you could use as an "About" page on your
      website. Include your name and a few paragraphs describing who you are.
    </li>

    <li>
      Take the page that you created in Exercise 1 and add some headings. Include
      multiple heading levels to divide the page into logical sections.
    </li>

    <li>
      Look at your page one more time and add a few of the character
      formatting tags.
    </li>
    </ol>
