    <h2>Adding Images to your Pages</h2>

    <p>There are several image file formats you can use you can insert into your
    web pages. These most commonly used are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>"GIF"</li>
      <li>"JPG"</li>
      <li>"PNG"</li>
      <li>"SVG"</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There are more, but </p>

    <p>
      In order to include an image on your site, you have to store it on your server
      and provide the address of the graphic in an <code>img</code> tag. You will almost
      always use relative addresses for graphic files.</p>

    <div class="note">
      <p>
        Netiquette dictates that your graphics be stored in your own web site's
        directories or on another site that you own. The only exception to this rule
        would be if the owner of the graphic specifically states that linking
        directly to the graphic is all right.
      </p>

      <p><em>Never, never, link to other people's graphics without their permission.</em></p>
    </div>

    <p>An image tag looks like this:</p>

    <pre>&lt;img src="image.gif" alt=""&gt;</pre>

    <p>
      Of course, you would replace <em>"image.gif"</em> with the name of your own image
      file. You can use relative addressing here as well, so you can store all of
      your images in a directory called <em>images</em> or <em>pictures</em> or whatever. The path to
      the file would then look like this: "images/image.gif".
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Here is an example:
    </p>

    <img src="img/chance_small.jpg" alt="Chancellor" width="428" height="524">

    <p>
      There are several other pieces of information you should include in an img tag.
      One is text that will be displayed for people who have browsers incapable of
      displaying graphics (or who are surfing the 'net with graphics turned off.)
    </p>

    <p>
      You should also include information about the height and width of the graphic,
      because it will allow the web browser to display the text on your page more
      quickly because it can leave an appropriate amount of space for the graphic
      while the graphic is downloaded to the reader's computer. A full image tag
      would look like this:
    </p>

    <pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;img src="fido.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Picture of my dog." &gt;
    </code></pre>

    <h3>The &lt;picture&gt; Element</h3>

    <h3>Just one more... the &lt;figure&gt; Element</h3>

    <figure id="matt_05">
      <img src="img/matt_05.jpg" alt="" width="214" height="262">
      <figcaption>May the Force be with You</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h2>Exercises</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Go back to your About page and add a picture of yourself. Use any of
        the image elements I showed you in this tutorial.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you haven't already, create a figure. Make sure that you include the
        <code>figcaption</code> element too.
      </li>
    </ol>
