    <h2>Working with Links</h2>
    <div class="note">
      <p><strong>NOTE</strong></p>
      <p>
        In this tutorial I have added some line breaks to the example coding.
        If you decide to copy this code for your own pages, you don't need to add the
        carriage returns unless you want to. It will work correctly either way.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      There are three basic types of links you will use in creating websites:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>External links - links to other pages</li>
      <li>Internal links - links within the same page</li>
      <li>e-mail links</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When you want to link to other pages, you use the link tag. It looks something
    like this:</p>

    <pre><code class=" html language- html">&lt;a href="address"&gt;The text that people click to get to the page.&lt;/a&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <p>The word address would be replaced with the address of the page you want to
    link to. There are two types of link addresses: relative and absolute. Use
    relative addresses to link to other pages within your own web site. For
    example, if I had a page called news.html, I could create a link to it like
    this:</p>

    <pre><code class=" html language- html">Read the latest &lt;a href="news.html"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt; about this site.
    </code></pre>

    <p>This assumes that the file "news.html" is located in the same directory where
    the page with the link is stored. You can refer to files in other directories
    on your site by including the relative path. For example, if I have a directory
    called "personal", and I want to provide a link to a file in that directory
    from a file in the main directory, I would use a link tag that looked like this:</p>

    <pre><code class=" html language- html">Take a look at &lt;a href="/personal/myresume.html"&gt;my resume.&lt;/a&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <p>The second type of link, the absolute link, includes the full internet address
    of the page to which you are linking. For example, if you wanted to create a
    link to my site, The Tangled Web, you would create a link tag like this one:</p>

    <pre><code class=" html language- html">Visit the &lt;a href="http://www.tangledwebgraphicsets.com"&gt;Tangled Web&lt;/a&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <p>The last type of link that you might want to include in your pages is the
    "mailto:" link. This link allows people to send e-mail to you easily and it uses
    the same link tag that is used to link to another web page. The difference is
    in the way you specify the address. An e-mail link looks like this:</p>

    <pre><code class=" html language- html">&lt;a href="mailto:irene@playingwithwebdesign.com"&gt;Send me a message!&lt;/a&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <p>Begin the address with "mailto" and then insert the e-mail address of the
    person to whom the message will be sent. When a reader clicks on this link,
    it will bring up the person's e-mail program and let them send an e-mail
    message to the e-mail address listed. It's probably a good idea to list the
    e-mail address in a form that will be visible to readers as well, just in case
    their browsers don't support this kind of link. The chances of that happening
    are getting smaller all the time, but it doesn't hurt to err on the side of
    caution. In other words, instead of the saying "Send me a message," say
    something like this:</p>

    <pre><code class=" html language- html">&lt;p&gt;Send me a message at:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href="mailto:webmaster@tangledwebgraphicsets.com"&gt;
      webmaster@tangledwebgraphicsets.com&lt;
    /a&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <p>That's it for basic link tags. There are other parameters you can include, but
    this will get you started.</p>

    <h3>Exercises</h3>

    <ol>
    <li>
      Go back to your About page and add some links. Maybe links to your
      employers or to some of your favorite websites.
    </li>

    <li>
      Add an email link to that About page so people can contact you by email.
    </li>

    <li>
      One more thing. Go through the About page one last time and add
      id attributes. Then add links at the top of the page that will
      allow readers to jump directly to the sections.
    </li>
    </ol>
