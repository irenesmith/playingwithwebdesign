    <p>Now that you know the basic sections that most web sites have, we
    can talk about individual pages. Certain elements should be
    included on every page in your web site. Let's list the true
    essentials first:</p>

    <h2 id="title">Title</h2>

    <p><em>Every page</em> on your web site should have a title. To
    include the title, use the &lt;title&gt; tag inside the
    &lt;head&gt; section, like this:<br>&nbsp;<br></p>

    <pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;Title&gt;Tangled Web - Tutorials&lt;/title&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <p>It's usually a good idea to include an abbreviated version of your
    site's name in the title because this is the text that people will
    see in their Bookmarks or Favorites list. It's sure a lot easier to
    get back to The Tangled Web when a bookmark says
    <strong>The Tangled Web</strong> than when there's a blank line in
    the list, isn't it?</p>

    <h2 id="navigation-list">Navigation List</h2>

    <p>Even if your site uses graphic buttons for navigation, you should
    also include a list of text links somewhere on each page as well.
    For one thing, as I said earlier, there are people who surf the
    'net with graphics turned off. For another, it makes a nice compact
    way to list the major sections at the top or bottom of the page.
    You'll notice that <em>every single page</em> at The Tangled Web has
    a list of text links at the bottom.</p>

    <h2 id="topofpage">Top of Page</h2>

    <p>If any of the pages in your site are long, it's a nice feature to
    add an id to the title or some other element near the the top of
    the page, and then sprinkle links to this anchor through the page.
    This means that at the end of a very long page full of text, the
    user can click once and return to the top of the page almost
    instantly, instead of having to scroll upwards slowly. An anchor
    looks like this:</p>

    <pre><code class=" html language- html">&lt;p id="PageTop"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <p>You can put anything you like or nothing at all between the opening
    and closing tag pair. It doesn't matter. To create a link to the
    anchor, simply use the following tag:</p>

    <pre><code class=" html language- html">&lt;p class="code"&gt;Back to the &lt;a href="#PageTop"&gt;Top of the Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <p>If you combine this tip with the next one, you can easily create a
    simple table of contents for long pages.</p>

    <h2 id="sectionanchors">Section Anchors</h2>

    <p>If your page is long enough to require links back to the top of the
    page, you should probably create anchors for each of the pages
    sub-headings. All anchors are made the same way as the top of page
    anchor in the previous tip, and all links to anchors are also made
    the same way. An added advantage of creating link destinations
    within a page with anchors is that you can link to the anchors from
    other pages in your site as well. For example, if I had an anchor
    called "LinkwareGraphics" on my links page, I could link
    to it from any other page, like this:</p>

    <pre><code class=" html language- html">&lt;p&gt;Check out these &lt;a href="links.html"&gt;links to other graphics sites.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <!-- TODO: Remember to actually create a link for the try it out! -->

    <p>And, just to show you that it really works (you can return by
    clicking your browsers "Back" button) try this one: Web Site
    Resources</p>

    <h2 id="emaillink">E-Mail Link</h2>

    <p>Once again with feeling! <em>Every single page</em> on your web
    site needs to have a valid e-mail link! Not one, not two, every
    page. I can't stress this enough. You need to give your visitors a
    way to contact you. You don't absolutely have to have a guestbook
    or a feedback form, but you <strong>MUST</strong> have a
    way for visitors to reach you. In fact, some of the places that
    give free web space make this one of the requirements you need to
    fulfill in order to keep your free space! Frankly, I can't see any
    reason for an honest web master to keep his e-mail a secret. If the
    thought of too much spam scares you off, create an e-mail account
    somewhere that you use only for your web site. Most of the free
    e-mail services allow you to impose spam controls, so you can
    quickly skim the good stuff and throw the junk away. It may take
    time to set that up, but it's worth it. Even if the only messages
    you get tell you about typos, at least you know someone is reading
    your pages.</p>

    <h2 id="copyrightnotice">Copyright Notice</h2>

    <p>Think this isn't important? Want to donate your work to the public
    domain? Fine. Even so, a notice that you have donated your work to
    the public domain is in order. Copyright notices may not stop
    thieves, but they do make it easier for honest people to give
    credit where it is due, that is, to <strong>YOU</strong>!
    In addition, it's much easier to prosecute copyright infringement
    when your work is marked with a copyright notice.</p>

    <h2 id="graphicscredits">Graphics Credits</h2>

    <p>Who made your graphics?</p>

    <p>You?</p>

    <p>That's great, then you should add this information to your
    copyright notice. If not, make sure you give credit where credit is
    due and place a link to the artist's home page (if they have one)
    on the page where you use the graphics. If you got your graphics
    from a clip art collection, say so. Once again, you're not going to
    stop thieves, but you'll make life much easier for honest people.</p>

    <p>There's probably more I could add to this list. In fact, I will add
    anything I should think of as time goes on. If I make any
    significant changes to this tutorial, I'll mention it on my "What's
    New" page.</p>
