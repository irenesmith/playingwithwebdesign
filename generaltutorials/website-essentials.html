    <h2>Website Essentials</h2>
    
<h1 id="websiteessentials">Website Essentials</h1>

    <p>There are certain sections (or pages) that every web site should
    include. Call them what you want, but every site should include
    the following elements:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Home Page</li>
    <li>Site Index</li>
    <li>What's New</li>
    <li>Resources</li>
    <li>Guestbook</li>
    <li>Feedback Form</li>
    <li>About</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="homepage">Home Page</h2>

    <p>Your home page should tell visitors a little bit about the site and
    what's available for their viewing pleasure. There are probably as
    many ways to greet visitors as there are web sites. Well... maybe
    not <em>that</em> many but there are a lot of ways to do it.</p>

    <p>For example, you might present a title graphic with or without a
    description of your site and an invitation to "Come on in!" Or
    you might present a site index with full descriptions of
    each section in your site. You might use a combination of these two
    elements.</p>

    <p>By the way, if thoughts of flashing background colors and
    automatic re-direction are swimming in your head, please don't! It
    was cute and interesting the first time someone did that,
    but now? Old hat. Find something else new and exciting for your
    front page.</p>

    <h2 id="siteindex">Site Index</h2>

    <p>If you don't use your home page as a site index, you should probably
    include a page that just lists and describes the various sections
    of your site. The idea is to make it easy for visitors to see
    what you have to offer.</p>

    <p>Make visitors wander randomly from page to page, and most people
    will give up and head for parts unknown, never to return! Whether
    you call it a menu, a site map, an index or whatever, make sure
    people can find what you're offering.</p>

    <p>Oh, and if you want to include a JavaScript menu or one of
    those drop-down lists, that's great! Just make sure you offer a
    plain text version of the information as well. There are still
    people who turn off JavaScript for safety reasons.</p>

    <h2 id="whatsnew">What's New</h2>

    <p>Call it a Site Journal, call it News, Ramblings, Musings, or just
    Stuff I Want You to Know, make sure you have some location where
    you tell people what's new and what's changed. Part of the reason
    for creating a site in the first place is to get people to visit
    you more than once... isn't it? Make sure those repeat visitors can
    tell where they should place their attention.</p>

    <h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>

    <p>If your web site is about yourself, you might not need a
    "resources" or "links" page. On the other hand, most people who
    have a web site have found some other site they want to share with
    their visitors. Even if all you want to share is links to
    your friends' pages, a links page is nice.</p>

    <p>Of course, it's possible to go too far!</p>

    <p>Unless the main reason for creating your site is to
    act as a resource to other sites that cover a certain topic, don't
    overdo it. There are search engines for that sort of thing.</p>

    <p>Also, make sure you tell people more about the sites in your
    list than their URLs! Take a look at my links page as an
    example. I won't include a site there without a description
    of what the site has to offer and, if I have a strong opinion
    about the site you can be sure I'm going to tell you that too.</p>

    <h2 id="feedbackform">Contact Form</h2>

    <p>Contact forms can be an invaluable tool in gathering information
      from your guests. This is particularly true if you are selling goods
      or services. A form the visitors can fill out to ask for more
      information can sometimes make the difference between making a sale
      and having the potential sale "sail" away on the tide.
    </p>

    <h2 id="about">About</h2>

    <p>This could be <a href="../about.html">About Me</a>, "About Us",
    or whatever. Many people, including me, like to know a little bit
    about the person who designed and/or owns the site they are
    visiting. If your site belongs to a company (yours or the one you
    work for) this page should include general information about the
    company. Another important thing to put here is how to contact
    someone. Of course, if this is your personal site, that someone
    should be you. Just make sure the e-mail address is correct!</p>
