    <h2>Getting Ready for Web Design?</h2>
    <p>
      If you haven't done any web development, there are a few things
      you will need in order to get started. I'm assuming at this point
      that you know enough about your computer to create and edit files.
      If you have used a word processor or spreadsheet, that's good
      enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some tools that make your work easier, but the truth is
      that you could use a plain text editor like Notepad on Windows or
      Text Editor on macOS. The good news is that free versions of most of
      those tools are available.
    </p>
    <h2>What you'll Need</h2>
    <p>
      I'm going to list the tools that I am current using here. There
      article, "Useful Tools" will provide more information and other
      choices, but this will get your started.
    </p>
    <h3>Code Editor/IDE</h3>
    <p>
      You need a good text editor in order to create HTML, CSS, and
      JavaScript files. A word processor won't do because the files
      are plain text and the invisible formatting characters that a
      word processor adds would make the file unreadable in a web
      browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      Better yet, you should get an <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr>
      to help you manage your projects. The advantage to an IDE is that
      it lets you see and manage all of the files in your project.
    </p>
    <p>
      My current favorite is
      <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a>,
      a free IDE from Microsoft. VS Code has a lot of features to make
      your coding life easier. My current favorite is the fact that
      hovering over an HTML tag or CSS rule shows you an overview of the
      item and also provides a link to the item's page on MDN Web Docs.
    </p>
    <h3>Web Browser</h3>
    <p>
      If you're reading this, then you probably have a web browser installed.
      Which one you use is entirely up to you. As long as you  have the current
      version of your browser installed, you're probably good to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      I use Mozilla's Firefox web browser for many reasons, not the least of
      which is the developer tools they make available. I use the released
      version of Mozilla <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="_blank">Firefox</a>
      but I also use the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/" target="_blank">Developer Edition</a>.
      Firefox is what I use day to day, but I also have Google <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank">Chrome</a>,
      <a href="https://www.opera.com/download" target="_blank">Opera</a>, and
      Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge" target="_blank">Edge</a>
      installed on my system because, as a web developer, I need to test
      the sites I create in the major browsers to ensure that it behaves
      well and looks good in all of them.
    </p>
    <h3>Source Control</h3>
    <p>
      Source control protects your code and assets (such as pictures, videos,
      and other project data) and, although there are other tools, the most
      common tool is Git, a source control system that has been around for quite
      a while now. Git is helpful for individual developers as well as teams
      because you can store your code remotely, protecting you from disasters such
      as hard drive failure. It also protects you from you.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you're ready, sign up for <a href="" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. You
      probably don't have to worry about Git right away, but once you start
      creating more substantial sites, storing the code in a Git repository will
      save you a lot of time if all goes wrong. (Coming soon, tutorials to help
      you get started with Git and GitHub.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you've got your tools installed, let's begin by creating <a href="../htmltutorials/first.html">
      your first HTML page</a>.
