    <h2>Ready for Web Design?</h2>
    <p>
      If you haven't done any web development, there are a few things
      you will need in order to get started. I'm assuming at this point
      that you know enough about your computer to create and edit files.
      If you have used a word processor or spreadsheet, that's good
      enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some tools that make your work easier, but the truth is
      that you could use a plain text editor like Notepad on Windows or
      Text Editor on macOS. The good news is that free versions of most of
      those tools are available.
    </p>
    <h2>What you'll Need</h2>
    <p>
      You need a good text editor in order to create HTML, CSS, and
      JavaScript files. A word processor won't do because the files
      are plain text and the invisible formatting characters that a
      word processor adds would make the file unreadable in a web
      browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      Better yet, you should get an <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr>
      to help you manage your projects. The advantage to an IDE is that
      it lets you see and manage all of the files in your project. My
      current favorite is VS Code, a free IDE from Microsoft. It has a
      lot going for it.
