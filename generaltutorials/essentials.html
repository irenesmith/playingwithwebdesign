    <h2>Essential Elements</h2>

    <p>Certain pages and sections have become standard for websites.</p>

    <p>Depending on the type of website we are visiting, we've come to expect certain
    common features.</p>

    <p class="note">
      This tutorial was written for <strong>The Tangled Web</strong> but it has been
      updated to reflect today's web standards.
    </p>

    <p>
      Does it surprise you that what people expect to find on a website
      has changed somewhat over the years? I'm more surprised at how much
      has stayed the same. At least, the content people expect to find
      hasn't changed that much. But the way we present it does. I'll talk
      more about that in the <a href="web-page-essentials">Page Essentials</a>
      tutorial.
    </p>

    <p>Of course, how you present them is where the creativity comes in.</p>

    <p>Let's take a look at some of the elements that every website should
    have and then we'll also look at those elements that every page in
    your site should have.</p>

    <p>None of the ideas I'm presenting are hard and fast rules. Once you
    are familiar with the basics, you can do what you want.</p>
