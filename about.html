    <h2>About this Website</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Playing with HTML</strong> is a tutorial website created by Irene Smith. The site includes
      tutorials on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, graphics, and general web design.
    </p>

    <p>
      This site is the spiritual successor to The Tangled Web, a site that used to exist on a free
      web host called Fortune City. The site was started in 1998 and was part of the then popular
      collection of websites that gave away free web graphic sets. It looked like this:
    </p>

    <img id="tangledWeb" src="img/tangled_web.png" alt="Tangled Web landing page">

    <p>
      This site was laid out the old way, using tables but there are other ways to do things. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Don't worry, I'm not going to teach you 20-year old techniques here. Just showing you that
      I do have experience. I'm not offering graphic sets here either, but I do have tutorials
      and will be adding more on a regular basis. Tutorial categories include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>HTML</li>
      <li>CSS</li>
      <li>JavaScript</li>
      <li>Graphics</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you don't know any web technologies, start with <a href="htmltutorials/first.html">Your First Page</a>
      and then go on from there. Oh, and you might want to stop off at <a href="generaltutorials/getting-ready.html">
      Getting Ready for Web Design</a> to get pointers to the tools you might want to work with.

    <h2>About Irene</h2>

    <img id="ireneMozilla" src="img/irene_fox.png" alt="A picture of Irene Smith" width="150" height="150" />

    <p>
      I am a writer, designer, and programmer. I have been programming
      since 1982 and started writing about programming and other technical subjects
      in 1989.
    </p>

    <p>
      What started out as a hobby has become a career. As of 2019, I have worked
      for many well-known Tech companies including Microsoft, Google, and Mozilla.
      I am currently the Firefox Developer Content Manager for MDN Web docs,
      writing about Firefox Developer Tools and Browser Extensions.
    </p>

    <p>
      I taught myself to create websites in 1996, when my son was an infant.
      Web Development started as a fun thing to do. Once I learned the rudiments
      of creating web pages, I went nuts and created websites at many of the free
      web hosts that were available back then, such places as GeoCities, Tripod,
      Fortune City, and more.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have kept my skills up to date over the years, and now I want to pass my
      knowledge along. I hope you enjoy this website and that it teaches you
      something you didn't already know about web development.
